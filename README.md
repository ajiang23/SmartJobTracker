# **Project Proposal - SmartJobTracker**

## **What does it do?**
The **SmartJobTracker** application helps users track job applications, update their statuses, and gain insights from historical data. By streamlining the job search process, it ensures users stay organized and proactive. 

## **Who will use it?**
This application is designed for **students and professionals** who need a structured and efficient way to manage their job search.  

## **Why does it matter?**
Tracking job applications can be overwhelming. Many job seekers tend to rely on confirmation emails or Word/Excel documents, but these methods lack **consistency, automation, and intelligence**. 

**SmartJobTracker** eliminates these inefficiencies by providing a **centralized, time-sensitive, and intelligent tracking system** to help users manage their applications effectively.
